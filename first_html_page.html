        HTML is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language.
        It is a standard markup language that is used for creating Web pages.
        HTML is basically a markup language used to define the structure of a webpage.
        The language consists of a series of tags that can be paired or unpaired.
        HTML elements instruct the browser how to display the content.
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
