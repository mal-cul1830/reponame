                JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. 
                It is versatile and can be used to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and a lot more!
                JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, 
                unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
                <ul>
                <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; 
                    collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that are applied to HTML to help the building of sites and applications happen a lot faster.</li>
                </ul>
